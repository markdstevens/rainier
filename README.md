# ðŸš  Rainier
Rainier is a lightweight javascript framework for building isomorphic react applications. It's sole purpose is to allow developers to focus on writing application code rather than spending endless hours writing configurations for webpack, server-side rendering, babel, typsescript, etc. Out of the box, rainier supports:

âœ… Typescript <br />
âœ… React <br />
âœ… Server side rendering <br />
âœ… Route-based code splitting with webpack <br />
âœ… Declarative API for creating routes <br />

Rainier is **not** an oppionated, monolith framework that forces you to use a particular css framework, test framework, etc. You don't even have to use typescript if you don't want to; Rainier supports vanilla javascript as well.
